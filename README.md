# Game-2048
  Implementing Game-2048 in C++
Before implementing the game, following are some obervation points I noted:-
* Target of the game - To get 2048 in any of the cells
* If we get | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | in any row, 
  * then pressing right results in  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 4 | 4 | 
  * then pressing left results in   | 4 | 4 | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
